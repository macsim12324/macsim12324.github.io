## 📖 Description
This project implements a **semantic analysis check** to validate `switch` statements. It ensures that:

- All `case` labels are **unique**
- Only **one `default` case** is allowed
- Any violation is reported as a **semantic error**

This type of check is performed during the **semantic analysis phase** of a compiler.

## 🎯 Objective
The main goal of this tool is to detect invalid `switch` statements by enforcing:

- No duplicate `case` values
- No multiple `default` labels

## ⚙️ How It Works
- A set is used to store all `case` labels.
- Before inserting a new `case`, the checker verifies uniqueness.
- A boolean flag tracks the presence of a `default` label.
- Errors are reported when rules are violated.

- Disk Space: Minimum of 50 MB available space

## 🔍 How to Use the Semanticchecker
1. **Input Your Code:** Once the application opens, you will find an input area for your `switch` statements. Paste your code there.
  
2. **Run the Check:** After pasting your code, click the "Check" button. The checker will process your input and alert you of any semantic errors.

3. **Review Errors:** If there are any duplicates or multiple `default` cases, the checker will highlight these issues. Take note of the specific errors listed.

4. **Correct and Recheck:** Make the necessary corrections to your code and click the "Check" button again to validate the changes. 

## 📝 Features
- User-friendly interface for easy validation.
- Quick checks for uniqueness of `case` labels and multiple `default` cases.
- Clear error messages to help you understand issues in your code.

## 🚀 Technical Details
The semanticchecker operates by utilizing an internal mechanism. Here's a brief overview:

- It uses a data structure to manage `case` labels efficiently.
- Upon detection of a duplicate `case` or additional `default`, it generates an informative error message.
- Each validation runs in real-time, providing immediate feedback.
